There are 3 ways to deal with deadlocks: recovery, prevention and avoidance. 
Recovery method is used when we care about following things: 
 *    no limitation on the resource access or restrict process actions
 *    no delays of the process initiation 
 *    facilitates processing of deadlocks online
- but its disadvantage is inevitable preemptive losses;
Prevention method is used when these properties are not particularly crucial for us:
 *    requires long waiting time 
 *    inefficient use of allocated resources 
 *    process not knowing in advance all the required resources
Avoidness method is used when following losses can be afforded:
 *    resources that will be used in future should be known in advance 
 *    Some processes can be blocked for a long period of time 
 *    Only fixed number of resources exists for allocation
