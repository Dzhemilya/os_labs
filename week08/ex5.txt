Physical addressing means that your program really knows the real location of RAM.
For example, by accessing a variable at 0x31337, you are in fact accessing the physical RAM chips in which this variable is stored.
With virtual addressing, all accesses to the application's memory are sent to the page table, which is then mapped to the virtual to the physical address.
Thus, each application has its own "private" address space, and no program can read or write data to the memory of another program. This is called software segmentation.
