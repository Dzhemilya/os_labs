With 8-KB pages and a 16-bit virtual address space, the number of virtual pages is 2^16/2^13, which is 2^3=8.
It is obvious, because you need to divide system virtual adress space for table of pointers for pages and pointers
within pages. If we increase size of page, we decrease size of possible VPT. This works in both directions.
